## About

Bytestorm is a 2d Bullethell Sidescroller built in 2 weeks for a capstone project. If you want to play it yourself you can download it at https://oirien.itch.io/bytestorm or you can compile it yourself by downloading the project files, and opening it in Godot 4.

The project also included a full stack webapp at the following repository links.

https://github.com/Oirien/ByteStorm_Backend
https://github.com/ByteStormDevTeam/ByteStorm_Frontend

These along with the database were all hosted on AWS but have since been taken down.
